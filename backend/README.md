## Instructions to Deploy Locally

Unzip both the `SQL_SCRIPTS.zip` file.

Then open up mysql workbench and run the CreateVinderDB.sql script in the SQL_SCRIPTS folder. Then run the PopulateVinderDB.sql script also located in the SQL_SCRIPTS folder that was created when the SQL_SCRIPTS.zip file was unzipped.

To run the server, import the VinderServer project by importing archive file in eclipse and import the VinderServer.zip file. Then you can run the VinderServer project on Apache Tomcat. (Preferrably Tomcat9)

If the server archive import fails, there is a VinderServer.war file that can be imported and run in Eclipse.
